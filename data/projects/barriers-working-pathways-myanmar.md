<p>This project considers women’s empowerment in Myanmar. Over the next three years, ISID researchers will collaborate with the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok and the Gender Equality Network (GEN) of Myanmar to understand and analyse barriers and working pathways to women’s political participation in Myanmar. This interdisciplinary effort, with economists, political scientists, sociologists and CSO analysts will combine quantitative and qualitative research in the field to assess women’s role in the political process in Myanmar at both the state and federal levels.</p>

<p>This project is under the umbrella of <em>Canada’s Knowledge for Democracy Myanmar initiative</em>. This initiative, an IDRC and Global Affairs Canada partnership, seeks to support democratic transition in Myanmar through policy research.</p>
